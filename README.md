# Battleships 

Battleships is an engaging strategy-based guessing game where you can challenge the computer. At the outset, both the player and the computer receive a 5x5 grid, each with four randomly positioned ships. The ship locations are concealed from the opposing player; while the player can view their own ships, the computer's ships remain hidden. To make a guess, input coordinates, comprising one row integer and one column integer separated by a space. After guessing, you will either hit or miss; duplicates of the same coordinates are not allowed. The ultimate aim of the game is to sink all of the opponent's ships.
