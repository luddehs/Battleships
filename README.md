# Battleships 

Battleships is an engaging strategy-based guessing game where you can challenge the computer. At the outset, both the player and the computer receive a 5x5 grid, each with four randomly positioned ships. The ship locations are concealed from the opposing player; while the player can view their own ships, the computer's ships remain hidden. To make a guess, input coordinates, comprising one row integer and one column integer separated by a space. After guessing, you will either hit or miss; duplicates of the same coordinates are not allowed. The ultimate aim of the game is to sink all of the opponent's ships.

## How to Play
- Before starting the game, you need to choose a name consisting of at least three letters and press enter.
- Once your name is validated, your game board, consisting of five rows and five columns, will be displayed, with four ships randomly positioned on it.
- Your opponent, the computer, will also receive a game board with its ships hidden from you.
- Now, the game begins:
  - Make a guess by entering coordinates.
  - Input two integers ranging from 0 to 4, separated by a space. The top-left corner corresponds to row 0, column 0.
  - Press enter to submit your guess.
- Updated game boards will be printed and reveal the outcome of each guess:
  - If your guess hits a ship, a "*" will appear at the coordinates, accompanied by a "Hit!" message.
  - If your guess misses, an "X" will appear at the coordinates, along with a "Miss!" message.
- To win, either you or the computer must sink all of the opponent's ships.
